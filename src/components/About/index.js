          My name is Ivy Stephenson and I am a Junior Full Stack Web Developer. I am very passionate about coding and web development and look forward to learning more languages in the future. I currently have a certification from Vanderbilt University's IT/Web Development and Coding program, and an Audio Engineering Degree from SAE Institute. I have been working an internship at DaVita, a healthcare company, as a junior web developer. I am currently also studying to get my SCRUM master certification to manage and assist other developers on a team using AGILE and SCRUM methodology.
